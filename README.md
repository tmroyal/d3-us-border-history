# d3-us-border-history
A visualization of the evolution of borders in the United States of America.

[Live Demo](http://tmroyal.github.io/d3-us-border-history/)

Historical border data is provided by the Dr. William M. Scholl Center for American History and Culture
at the Newberry Library. Original GIS data is available under a creative commons license 
at [http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/downloads/united_states.html](http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/downloads/united_states.html).

# Caveats

- In the dataset, there is mention made of the state of Deseret. This is not drawn on this visualization, but it is included in
  the dataset.
- The dataset does not include Confederate Status during the civil war, so this was included programmatically.
- It does not include Guam, the Phillipines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Virgin islands, and numerous other current and historical U.S. Territories.
